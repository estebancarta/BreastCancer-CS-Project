# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction

## Authors
Esteban Cartagenova, Felipe Suquillo

## Project Description
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict the survival probability of breast cancer patients, based on a dataset from the SEER Program (2006–2010).  
The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), class imbalance handling, training of classification models, hyperparameter optimization, and an analysis of implementation costs.

## Repository Structure
- `Final submission.ipynb` — Main notebook containing the full workflow.

## How to Run
1. Download the `Final submission.ipynb` file.
2. Run it using a Jupyter Notebook environment (such as Anaconda, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).
3. Make sure the following libraries are installed:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn
    - imbalanced-learn
4. Execute all cells sequentially to fully reproduce the project.
